# Titan Robotics 5587 FRC Dashboard
**A pit clock for FRC matches powered by The Blue Alliance's API.**

This dashboard is made entirely with PHP and is hosted at https://parkerdaletech.com/testing/frc/dashboard/.

To start the clock, simply enter your team code; "frc" followed by your team number (eg: `frc5587`) and the event code; specified on the event's TBA page (eg: `2019chcmp`).

The clock is still in development, and this is by no means a release. Thank you for understanding if there is a bug.
