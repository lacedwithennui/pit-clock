**How to add credentials:** make a new json file called credentials.json that contains the following:
```
{"apiKey": "tba_apiKey"}
```
where tba_apiKey is your APIv3 key from The Blue Alliance.

**How to use the input screen:**
Put in your team number or team key (eg. 5587 or frc5587), and your event key. Your event key is part of the TBA link for your event (eg. 2023vaale). If the event has already started, you can check "Use Latest Event" and the program will find the event key for you.
